# SynoTool
Synology monitoring utility for macOS.

This app was published to Mac App Store for couple of years.

It was designed to monitor and manage Synology NAS devices with simple interface on Mac's.

I developed this app using some non-official API (which later was published), by reverse-engineering Synology Web tools and js calls.

All design and drawing of UI self made.
